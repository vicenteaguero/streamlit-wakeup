## Description
This script automates waking up Streamlit apps by periodically visiting their URLs.
It uses Selenium to perform the automation in a headless Chrome browser.
The use of Cron Jobs is recommended to schedule the script execution.
In the README file, you will find instructions on how to set up the script and the Cron Job.
